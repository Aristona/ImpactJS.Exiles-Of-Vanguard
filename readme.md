Hi,

This is a basic ARPG game built with ImpactJS Javascript Game Engine. Some facts:

- Made it in 2 days.
- Spent 10 hours on finding assets, or drawing assets myself.
- Spent 20 hours on learning ImpactJS, reading documentation and developing the game.
- It was the best way to spend a weekend!

Demo can be found here: [http://www.anilunal.com/games/exiles-of-vanguard/]() (version may differ)

Repository is here for reference and educational purposes.

Made in Kastamonu with love. :o
